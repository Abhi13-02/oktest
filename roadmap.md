8-Hour Roadmap
Hour 0 - 1: Setting Up Core Structure & Integrations
Firebase Setup:
Configure Firestore for user data and test storage.
Set up Firebase storage for uploaded PDFs.
Implement authentication for students and teachers.
Cohere Integration:
Add API integration for parsing PDFs into structured Q&A (questions and answers format).
Ensure parsed questions are stored in Firestore with fields like:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "question": "Sample Question",
  "answer": "Correct Answer",
  "difficulty": "medium"
}
Hour 1 - 2: User & Classroom Management
User Registration & Classroom Setup:
Implement student and teacher roles.
Allow teachers to create classrooms and share access links (stored in Firestore).
Students can request to join classrooms.
Teachers approve student requests.
Classroom Dashboard:
Teachers view a list of students in each classroom.
Students see the list of tests assigned to them.
Hour 2 - 3: Upload & Create Tests
Test Creation:

Create a test form for teachers to upload PDFs and specify test details (title, duration, type).
Convert PDFs using the Cohere API to extract Q&A pairs.
Store the test with its questions in Firestore under the respective classroom.
Test Management:

Allow teachers to preview and edit parsed questions before publishing the test.
Hour 3 - 4: Taking Tests & Test Simulation
Test Interface for Students:
Display questions one at a time.
Provide answer options for MCQs and input fields for other formats.
Track whether each question is answered correctly, incorrectly, or not attempted.
Competitive Test Simulation:
Use Firestore’s real-time capabilities to show students’ progress and display a live leaderboard.
Track and update scores instantly based on each student’s performance.
Hour 4 - 5: Analytics & Leaderboard
Leaderboard:

For each classroom, calculate scores and display rankings based on test results.
Performance Analytics:

For each student, show:
Number of correct and incorrect answers.
Average score and score trends across tests.
Time taken for each question (tracked during the test).
Basic AI-Powered Insights: (Optional if time permits)

Provide suggestions like “Focus on Topic X” based on frequently incorrect answers.
Hour 5 - 6: Adaptive Testing
Adaptive Difficulty Adjustment:
Categorize questions into easy, medium, and hard based on teacher input or past performance.
During practice tests, dynamically adjust difficulty:
Start with medium questions.
Increase to hard if the student answers correctly.
Decrease to easy if the student struggles.
Hour 6 - 7: Gamification
Badges & Streaks:
Award badges for milestones like:
“First Test Completed.”
“Perfect Score.”
“5-Day Study Streak.”
Daily Streak Tracker:
Track daily login and test completion streaks to encourage consistent engagement.
Hour 7 - 8: Community Discussion & Anti-Cheating
Community Forum:

Add a discussion feature where students can ask and answer questions about specific tests or solutions.
Use Firestore to store and retrieve forum threads.
Anti-Cheating Mechanism:

Basic time-tracking and screenshot capture (optional due to time constraints).
Detect duplicate answers or copy-pasting (basic plagiarism detection).
Offline Support (Optional if Time Allows):

Allow students to download tests as JSON or CSV files.
Implement offline test-taking with local storage for later synchronization.
Detailed Explanation of How Things Should Happen
Core User Flow
Registration & Classroom Management:

Users register and join classrooms. Teachers have full control over test assignments.
Uploading & Creating Tests:

Teachers upload PDFs and the system uses Cohere to parse them into structured questions.
Teachers review and edit questions before publishing.
Taking Tests:

Students take tests in a user-friendly interface.
Performance is tracked in real-time, updating the leaderboard.
Leaderboards & Analytics:

Leaderboards rank students based on scores.
Analytics provide insights into strengths and weaknesses.
Adaptive Testing & Gamification:

Tests dynamically adjust difficulty.
Gamification rewards encourage engagement.
Community Forum & Anti-Cheating:

Forums promote collaborative learning.
Anti-cheating features ensure fair competition.
Key Prioritization Notes
Focus first on essential features: uploading tests, taking tests, and leaderboards.
Add adaptive testing and gamification if time allows.
Community discussions and offline support can be considered as stretch goals.
